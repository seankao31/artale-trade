# Artale Trade

Artale Trade aims to be a dedicated, user-friendly web platform for players of MapleStory Artale (繁體中文服) to facilitate the trading of in-game items. Currently, the game lacks an in-game auction house or a centralized trading system, forcing players to rely on disparate and inefficient methods like Discord channels, forums, or in-game megaphones. Though third-party alternatives exist, each has its own downside. While an in-game market is anticipated, this platform will serve as a valuable alternative, offering features and a user experience potentially not covered by the official solution.
